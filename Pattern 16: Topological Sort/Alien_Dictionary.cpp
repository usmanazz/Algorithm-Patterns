// PROBLEM: There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the alphabets. 
// Write a method to find the correct order of the alphabets in the alien language. It is given that the input is a valid 
// dictionary and there exists an ordering among its alphabets.

// EXAMPLE: Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
//          Output: bac
//          Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
//          from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
//
//          1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
//          2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'

From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"
